# Simple Banking System

This project is part of Week 3 of the Go course. It implements a basic banking system to practice structs, methods, pointers, interfaces, and concurrency.

## How to run

Run the banking system simulation from the `cmd` directory:

```bash
# Example:
go run cmd/main.go
```

## Tasks
- Create a struct for BankAccount.
- Implement deposit and withdraw methods.
- Use goroutines and channels to simulate concurrent transactions.
